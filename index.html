                        be hard to find a safe place to park a bike especially when in an unfamiliar area. Students are
                        only too aware of the high levels of bike theft with over 2 million bicycles stolen in the USA
                        every year.

                    <p class="lead">Firstly, to better explore students experiences of cycling at UCI, we
                        interviewed
                        three students who regularly bike to campus. The observations we noted were:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Students often biked to a place and then looked around to find a suitable Bike Park. It
                            would be helpful to see bike parks near the user's current location.</li>
                        <li>A variety of mapping apps were used such as Google Maps and Strava so integration with other
                            map applications would be helpful.</li>
                        <li>Bike safety is important so ratings or reviews of a bike park would help in deciding
                            how safe a bike park is
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>In the words of our inteview participants:<br><br>
                        <q>I think it could be better if it’s integrated in the mapping software that I’m already
                            using.</q><br>
                        <q>Sometimes I get an understanding of where I could find a bike rack so long as I’ve been
                            there.
                            But otherwise, I'm fishing around</q>

                            native map service such as Google Maps.</li>
                        <li>A preview of the bike park is important especially photos or a panoramic view.</li>
                        <li>It is important to see what other cyclists think to a bike park including a rating and
                            opinions on cleanliness, maintenance.</li>
                        <li>Cyclists prefer to park their bike in a spot with lots of other bikes as they feel there is

                    <h3>Usability Testing</h3>
                    <p class="lead">We asked two different students to complete a usability test on the
                        BikePark high fidelity prototype. </p>
                    <p>We
                        asked them to complete tasks related to searching for a destination and finding nearby bike
                        parks, getting directions to a bike
                        park, and reading/writing a review of
                        a bike park. </p>
                    <p>Each test was performed over Zoom where the student shared their screen and spoke
                        aloud as they tried to complete each task.</p>
                    <p>The tests were performed a week apart so we had time to revise the prototype with feedback from
                        the first participant.</p>

                    <h3>Results</h3>
                    <p class="lead">The usability testing gave us valuable insights into improvements for
                        future versions of the prototype.</p>
                    <p>The first participant asked for the ability to indicate where they had parked their bike to make
                        it easier to retrieve their bike. We added this feature "pin bike park" to our prototype before
                        the second
                        usability test.</p>
                    <p>The second participant did not find the "pin bike park" intuitive. They also mentioned it would
                        be better to change the color of the selected bike park icon when reading a review. These are
                        both areas to improve upon in future versions of the BikePark app.</p>
                    <p>Additional feedback included the ability to see if a bike park is full and to prompt the user to
                        write a review once they'd collected their bike from a park.</p>

                    <p class="lead">We are very happy with the final prototype. We feel it incorporates the key features
                        mentioned by
                        our users and is reasonably intuitive given the feedback from the usability tests</p>
                    <p>Future versions need to consider how best to support the "pin bike park" feature as we are not
                        happy with the usability of that feature. However, we feel the prototype is good enough to
                        develop into a mobile app showcasing the MVP features of BikePark.</p>
